    <h3>Defination of H<sub>2</sub>O:</h3>
    <pre><bold>Water (H<sub>2</sub>O) is a transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless chemical
    substance that is essential for all known forms of life. It covers about
    71% of Earth's surface, primarily in oceans, rivers, and lakes. Water
    exists in three states: liquid, solid (ice), and gas (vapor). It plays a
    crucial role in biological processes, climate regulation, and sustaining
    ecosystems. The human body is composed of about 60% water, making it vital
    for hydration, digestion and health.<bold/></pre>

    <h3>molecular structure of H<sub>2</sub>O:</h3>
    <pre>the moleculer structure of H<sub>2</sub>Oconsists of two H-molecule covalently with 
    one O-atom forming a v-shaped bent with a bond angle of 104.5<sup>0</sup>.which makes the
    water a polar molecule wirh a partial negetive charge near oxygen(O) and partial
    posetive charges near hydrogen(H).</pre>

    <h3>Uses of H<sub>2</sub>O:</h3>
    <pre>   Warer is one of the most important element in our daily life routine,like :
    1.We drink water,which helps us to survive 
    2.we use water for bath also to clean ourselves 
    3.water is also used for washing dishes along with cooking
    <h4>Remark:</h4>water is must for our day to day life routine and humans or most of the 
    other living beings can't live without water,its also essential for day to day works,but
    all of us should use water properly and with minimal wastage of water </pre>
